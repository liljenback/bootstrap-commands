# Bootstrap Commands

A script that checks if certain commands are installed and if not installs them.

You can look in [commands-common.sh](commands-common.sh) and adjust what commands should be evaluated.

## How to Run

```bash
. ./bootstrap-commands.sh
```
>NOTE: To include the . in front of the script (to make env variables available)

## Misc

The commands is developed for Ubuntu (Debian) but could probably quite easily be modified for any Linux based OS.
